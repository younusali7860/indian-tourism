                    The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in
                    the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658)
                    to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
                    himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and
                    a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
                    sides by a crenellated wall.
                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases
                    of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                    entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated.
